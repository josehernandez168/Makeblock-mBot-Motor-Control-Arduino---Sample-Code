# Makeblock-mBot-Motor-Control-Arduino---Sample-Code

This repository incliudes basic code to control the Makeblock mBot robot's motors.
Notice that there are two different codes. This is because of different
motor driver configuration in these robots. 

The robot with motor driver TB6612FNG (24 pin package) uses 
makeblock_mBot_code_1. For the other driver configuration with
two separate 8 pin motor drivers use makeblock_mBot_code_2.
